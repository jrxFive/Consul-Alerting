#Consul Alerting

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/jrxFive/consulalerting](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/jrxFive/consulalerting?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)
A set of python files for Consul for checks, watches, and notifications. By using tags for services and checks,
consulalerting will notify the corresponding groups by whichever plugins are also in the tags list. For example
the redis service has plugins enabled for "hipchat" and will route notifications via hipchat to "devops" and "dev".
These routes are defined in the Consul KV under alerting/notify/, and can be setup using ConsulAlertingKVBoostrap.py, Consul KV, or programatically.


#High Availability
Consulalerting is not a separate daemon, each time a watch is triggered Consul itself will trigger the WatchCheckHandler. To ensure notifications are
received even if the local instance of the consul server is down, other instances will still notify. This is done by using Consul's session locking
feature with a TTL so in case consulalerting fails that specific hash of the catalog will continue to get reported on in the future.
By installing consulalerting on each Consul server and registering the watch, the first consulalerting instance to acquire a lock for the
current catalog md5sum hash will process the corresponding notifications. As long as Consul servers itself are not in a failed state consulalerting
will continue to notify.


# Using Tags to notify

```javascript
{
  "service": {
    "name": "redis",
    "tags": ["devops","master","hipchat","dev"],
    "port": 8000,
    "checks": [{
      "script": "/usr/local/bin/check_redis.py",
      "interval": "10s"
    }]
  }
}
```

# Install steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jrxFive/consulalerting
cp -r consulalerting/consulalerting <DESTINATION_FOLDER>
# edit ConsulAlertingKVBoostrap.py or setup manually on ConsulKV interface
python consulalerting/ConsulAlertingKVBoostrap.py
```

After installing consulalerting in a directory of your choosing, use/edit ConsulAlertingKVBootstrap.py to ensure
the scripts can obtain the necessary KV information from Consul.

## Example ConsulAlertingKVBoostrap.py
```python




blacklist_nodes = ["fqdn","other_fqdn"]
blacklist_services = ["redis"]
blacklist_checks = ["service:redis"]

health_check_tags = ["devops","hipchat","techops"]

notify_hipchat= {"api_token":"",
                 "url":"https://api.hipchat.com/v1/rooms/message",
                 "rooms":{"devops":3},
                        {"techops":4},
                 }

notify_slack= {"api_token":"",
                 "rooms":{"techops":"#techops"}}

notify_mailgun= {"api_token":"",
                 "mailgun_domain":"",
                 "from": "consul@domain.com",
                 "teams":{"devops":["guy@example.com","girl@example.com"],
                          "qa": "lonelyqa@example.com"}
                 }

notify_email= {"mail_domain_address":"email.domain.com",
               "username":"",
               "password":"",
               "from": "consul@domain.com",
               "teams":{"devops":["guy@example.com","girl@example.com"],
                          "qa": "lonelyqa@example.com"}
                }

notify_pagerduty = {"teams":{
                             "devops":"<SERVICE_KEY>"
                             }
                   }
}

```

| Variable Name | Type | Description |
| ------------- |------------- | ----- |
| blacklist_nodes | List | Consul agents are not to notify of state changes, by "Node" name in /v1/health/node/<node> |
| blacklist_services | List | Consul agents are not to notify of particular services, by "ServiceName" in /v1/health/node/<node> |
| blacklist_checks | List | Consul agents are not to notify based on checks, by "CheckID" in  /v1/health/node/<node> |
| health_check_tags | List | Tags to be used to determine who to alert to and what type of alerts for non-application checks |


## Wildcard Blacklist
If you wish to disable all notification for a certain blacklist type simply use ["*"] as the blacklist array value.


After the script is run, you can always change these within the Consul UI

## Consul Watch Check Handler Setup
```javascript
{
  "watches": [

      "type": "checks",
      "handler": "<DESTINATION_FOLDER>/consulalerting/WatchCheckHandler.py >> <LOG_FILE_LOCATION>"
    }
  ]
}
```
